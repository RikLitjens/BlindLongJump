# BlindLongJump

A github with all the (final) Arduino code we used for the product and for testing the radio connectivity.

Receiver is the code that is in the armband-Nano

Transmitter is the code that is in the sensor-Nano next to the track.

TestReceiver and testTransmitter are for testing whether the radio modules worked properly.

TestComponent tests whether the radio module is properly attached to the Nano.
